<h2>Tester Login</h2>

<p>If you are a tester, please use the primary email address you have 
registered with. If you have not created a tester account, please sign-up and
register. You will then be able to register all the email addresses you have 
used, currently use or plan to use for reports submissions, to this account.</p>

<form method="post" action="[% cgipath %]/pages.cgi">
    <input type="hidden" name='act' value='user-logged' />

    <table width="100%">
    <tr><td>Email</td>
        <td><input type="text" name="cause" /></td>
        <td rowspan="2">
            <p>Forgotten your password? Just enter your email
            and click the 'forgot my password' button below. We will then
            send you a new password.</td>

     <tr><td>Password</td>
         <td><input type="password" name="effect" /></td>

     </table>
</form>

<h2>Author Login</h2>

<p>If you are an author, please login using your standard PAUSE credentials.
You will then be able to browse your distributions and mark the appropriate
reports, which you believe to have been made in error.</p>

<p>In the interests of security, your PAUSE credentials will be used to 
dynamically verify you are an author by PAUSE directly. Once successfully 
verified, your PAUSE ID only is then held for the duration of the current
session, and deleted when the current session times out.<p>

<p>Please note that for those authors who are testers as well as authors, 
you will need to register separately as a tester to mark/verify the reports you
have sent as a tester. You should also register every email address you have
sent reports from.</p>

<form method="post" action="[% cgipath %]/pages.cgi">
    <input type="hidden" name='act' value='author-login' />

    <table>
    <tr><td>PAUSE</td>		<td><input type="text"		name="pause" /></td></tr>
