<p>In order to reduce the number of reports listed at any one time, three
methods for finding the reports you have issues with are employed.</p>

<h2>Browse by Date</h2>

<p>List reports attributed to your distributions based on the date they were 
submitted.</p>

<h2>Browse by Distribution</h2>

<p>Select one of your distributions to see the list of submitted reports. 
To see the reports for other versions you are maintainer of, use the drop 
down selection box to list the reports for another version.</p>

<h2>Browse by Tester</h2>

<p>Enter the email or name of a tester to see the list of submitted reports
they have submitted for one of your distributions.</p>

<h2>Find Report by ID</h2>

<p>Lastly you may request a specific report by clicking the appropriate link
in the menu and entering the report ID.</p>

<h2>Marking Reports</h2>

<p>If you have an issue with a report or series of reports, using one of the 
methods listed above, find the reports in question and mark them. This is 
simply done by selecting them and submitting the form. For each report, the
original tester will have to verify that the report was submitted in error. As
such an email is sent to the tester, requesting they review the report and
either agree with you and delete the report, or disagree with you and the 
report will be unmarked.</p>

<p>If after a week the reports remains marked, or if a report becomes unmarked
that you strongly disagree with, you may consult the administrative team and
provide your reasons for why the report was submitted in error. In this event,
please send an email to the admin@cpantesters.org mail address.</p>
