<p>This website is to enable authors and testers to highlight when reports have
been sent in error.<p>

<p>For authors, if you feel a report has been sent in error, please login using 
your PAUSE account details, and highlight the reports that you feel should not 
have been recorded within the CPAN Testers system. An email will then be sent 
to the tester in each case, who will be asked to verify the removal of these 
reports. In the event of the tester being unresponsive, please contact a member 
of the administration team. However, please leave at least 1 week between 
marking the report and contacting the administration team.</p>

<p>For testers, you will need to register your email address(es) to an account
within this website. Register as a tester, and for each email address you have
submitted reports for, you can confirm (via a challenge / response mechanism)
and verify you are the owner of that email address. Once that email address has
been verified you may mark reports you have sent for removal.</p>

<p>In both cases, if you require assistance you may contact the administration 
team or send an email to the 
<a href="http://lists.perl.org/list/cpan-testers-discuss.html">CPAN Testers 
Discussion mailing list</a>, where other members of the CPAN Testers community 
may be able to advise you of any issue.</p>

<h2>The Administration Team</h2>

<!--
<p>The administration team currently consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~BARBIE">Barbie</a></li>
<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~DAGOLDEN">David Golden</a></li>
</ul>
-->

<p>To contact the administration team, please send an email to admin &lt;at> 
cpantesters.org. Please do not email us individually unless you are unable to
get an initial response from the admin address.</p>


<h2>The CPAN Testers Fund</h2>

<p>CPAN Testers wouldn't exist without the help and support of the Perl 
community. However, since 2008 CPAN Testers has grown far beyond the 
expectations of it's original creators. As a consequence it now requires
considerable funding to help support the infrastructure.</p>

<p>In early 2012 the <a href="https://members.enlightenedperl.org">Enlightened 
Perl Organisation</a> very kindly set-up a
<a href="https://members.enlightenedperl.org/drupal/donate-cpan-testers">CPAN 
Testers Fund</a> within their donatation structure, to help the project
cover the costs of servers and services.</p>

<p>If you would like to donate to the CPAN Testers Fund, please follow the link
below to the Enlightened Perl Organisation's donation site.

<ul><li><a href="https://members.enlightenedperl.org/drupal/donate-cpan-testers">Donate 
to The CPAN Testers Fund</a></li></ul>

<p>If your company would like to support us, you can donate financially via the
fund link above, or if you have servers or services that we might use, please
send an email to admin@cpantesters.org with details.</p>

<p>Our full list of current sponsors can be found at our
